    "## Motivation\n",
    "For decades fantasy football has dominated the landscape of sports betting by striking a perfect balance\n",
    "between strategy, competition, and luck. It is a online game where participants can create their own football \n",
    "teams by selecting real life NFL players. Each participant, known as a manager, can draft these players from \n",
    "across the league, who will then earn points based on their real world game statistics every week. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although managers can continue to make changes to their team after the season starts, one of the most pivotal\n",
    "moments of the game is the draft, where players generally select 16 players onto their initial roster in a \n",
    "snake draft. Over the years, many different strategies for drafting have emerged, such as waiting on a quarterback\n",
    "(QB), drafting runningbacks (RB) and wide receivers (WR) in the earlier rounds, or waiting on a runningback to \n",
    "ensure the top talent in other positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a good draft has significant implications for the season overall. A manager is able to accept a player drafted\n",
    "late to underproduce, as the draft capital for the player is not very high and could easily be cut for free agents.\n",
    "However, if a player drafted within the early rounds (Rounds 1-6) underproduces, it causes significant turmoil since\n",
    "the manager spent a high capital for the player and would not get equivalent return value for trading the player. \n",
    "On the other hand, drafting a sleeper player in the later rounds that massively overproduces becomes a valuable asset \n",
    "and is a critical piece of championship teams, as the overall strength of a manager's team is improved with the same \n",
    "draft cost in relation to the other teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good draft strategy thus looks to minimize the risk of players within the early rounds, while is also good at finding \n",
    "the specific sleepers in the later rounds. \n",
    "\n",

    "a particular round.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does the runningback dead zone exist?\n",
    "* Is drafting a quarterback or tight end within the first 3 rounds worth the investment?\n",
    "* Which position has the most amount of sleepers?\n",
    "* How can we predict the number of points that will be scored by a player in a specific round in 2024?\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to use statistics and data science to answer the questions above. We hope that through this\n",
    "tutorial, the reader will gain a better understanding of the various draft strategies used in fantasy football as well as \n",
    "better understand how concepts within data science can more accurately model the performance of NFL players."
